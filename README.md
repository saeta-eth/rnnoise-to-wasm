# RNNoise to wasm.

This repository aims to create a wasm file from the RNNoise library.

To follow this goal, it uses Docker and NPM/Yarn tasks to run the process.

Usage:

- Run `yarn build` or `npm run build` and wait until the process finishes.
- It should create a dist folder where you can find the wasm file.
